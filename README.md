In this the code stopwatch.py is a python program file which is made using tkinter , in this application there are mainly 3 functionality and button . The first button is the start button then the stop button and
the third button is the reset button. To unit test the code I have divided the code into 3 parts first is the start button and second is the stop button and the third is the reset button .
To unit test them a module named "unittest" is used in which 3 test cases are used which basically check if the button is been clicked or when the reset button is clicked the clock resets to 00:00:00 .
